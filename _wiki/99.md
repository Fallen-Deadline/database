## Overview
The Cobra is a rare handgun in Unturned. It uses Cobra Magazines/Cobra Box which holds 20 and 40 rounds respectively.

The Cobra is a machine pistol, and can switch to automatic. Due to its fast fire rate, this gun can deal a lot of damage at close range. Because it has a slightly low amount of rounds for an automatic weapon, and it has high recoil, it is wise to shoot in small bursts.
