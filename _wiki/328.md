## Overview
The Locker has the most storage slots of all storages, and is the most durable storage. It can only be opened by its owner or group members, which makes it useful for players to store their items in without the risk of theft.

Like all other storages, if the Locker is destroyed, all items inside the Locker will drop on the ground.
